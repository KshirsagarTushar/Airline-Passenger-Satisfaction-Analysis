# Project Objective üéØ
The primary objective of the project is to leverage data analytics to gain actionable insights into passenger travel patterns, class preferences, and service satisfaction levels. By analyzing extensive data on passenger demographics, travel types, and service ratings, the project aims to identify key trends and behavior patterns among first-time and returning travelers. The study also focuses on evaluating the distribution of travel preferences across Business, Economy, and Economy Plus classes while examining demographic trends related to age and gender. Additionally, the project seeks to assess customer satisfaction levels and uncover areas for service improvement. Ultimately, the insights derived from this analysis are intended to help airline enhance customer experience, improve operational efficiency, and develop targeted strategies for fostering customer loyalty.
